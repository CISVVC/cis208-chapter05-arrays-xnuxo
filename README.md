# Note to Professor
I comitted this a bit after the deadline due to an error I couldn't seem to fix. When running the program with `make run`, it will run just fine but with an *Error: 204* appending it. However, if you simply run it as `./main`, it doesn't throw an error. Hopefully you can shed some light on why this is happening in my code. Thanks!
